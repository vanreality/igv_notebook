# Genomic Track Viewer with IGV in Jupyter Notebook

This repository provides a Python script to visualize **BAM, BED, and VCF** files using [IGV Notebook](https://github.com/igvteam/igv-notebook) in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

## Features
- üìä **Visualize BAM, BED, and VCF files** interactively in Jupyter.
- üé® **Color-coded labels** for easy track differentiation.
- ‚ö° **Supports human genome (hg38)** (modifiable for other genomes).

## Installation

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas igv-notebook matplotlib
```

If using Jupyter Notebook, install `jupyterlab`:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

## Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import the Required Modules

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Function for IGV Visualization
The function `view_genomic_tracks(df_samplesheet)` takes a **Pandas DataFrame** as input and loads the genomic tracks into an **IGV Browser** inside a Jupyter Notebook.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Your Data
You need to create a Pandas DataFrame containing the following columns:
- `name`: Track name
- `label`: Sample label (used for color coding)
- `type`: File type (`bam`, `vcf`, `bed`)
- `path`: Absolute file path

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the IGV Visualization
Call the function to visualize the genomic tracks inside a Jupyter notebook:

---

## Troubleshooting
- If files are not loading, ensure paths are correct.
- If IGV is not displaying tracks, restart Jupyter Kernel and retry.
- Ensure `igv-notebook` is installed.
